# Notes on SDLC and Databases

## 1. Digital Development Best Practices
- Deliver software that is **reliable**, meets **deadlines**, and stays within **budget**.
- Improve **adaptability** and **efficiency** by learning from past projects.

## 2. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
### Overview
- Processes for creating, delivering, and maintaining software efficiently.

### Key Phases
- **Planning**: Define goals, scope, and constraints.
- **Development**: Coding the software.
- **Testing**: Ensure quality standards.
- **Deployment**: Release the software.
- **Maintenance**: Provide ongoing support.

### Methodologies
- **Waterfall**: Sequential, for well-defined projects.
- **Agile**: Iterative and flexible, for projects with frequent changes.

## 3. Relational Databases
- Data stored in tables linked by relationships.
- Advantages: High data accuracy, efficient queries, data integrity.

## 4. NoSQL Databases
- Supports a variety of data types: key-value, document, graph.
- Ideal for large, distributed data and rapid development applications.

## 5. Data Warehouses and Data Lakes
### Data Warehouses
- Structured repository for transactional data.
- Supports complex queries and analysis.

### Data Lakes
- Stores raw, unstructured data.
- Suitable for big data and real-time analytics.
